Kryptos
=======

This is my PHP OOP code that I used to solve Kryptos K4

Here is the solution I found:

Remove the V located at character twenty five

Change characters thirty three to thirty five to SOS

Perform columnar rotation transposition using a column width of nine and thirty two

This will produce the text

The one time pad is the first string of text of the sculpture after being solved

KRYPTOS is padded at the beginning

Every six to ten letters are transposed to create scrambled words

This is done on a per word basis for every word six to eight letters in length

Words shorter than six letters are combined with the word after it such as ANDTHE or NUANCEOF to make up six to eight letters

Words that are longer than eight letters are split after the eighth letter

The remainder is prepended to the next word

The letters in each section of six to eight letters are transposed and produce the one time pad string

This is then applied to the aforementioned rotated cyphertext
